  <p class="left">
    The State of Queensland is situated in the
    northeast of the island-continent of Australia, between latitude 29
    deg. and 10 deg. south; longitude 153-1/2 and 138 deg. east.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What is Queensland?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    The richest State of the Commonwealth of
    Australia, with an area of 429,120,000 acres, over 3,000 miles of
    coast line, and the healthiest climate in the world.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

  <h3 class="left">How to get to Queensland.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    By any of the great steamship companies’
    boats that call at Brisbane (the capital), or by any vessel sailing
    for Australian ports.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Where to get Particulars re Passages.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    At the Queensland
    Agent-General’s Office, Marble Hall, 409 and 410 Strand, London, W.C.,
    and Immigration Depôt, Kangaroo Point, Brisbane.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Free Passages.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    These are granted from the United Kingdom to any port
    of Queensland to agricultural labourers introduced under contract.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Conditions of Free Passages.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    The employer must pay a fee of £7 for
    each labourer introduced, provide him with suitable accommodation, and
    guarantee him a year’s work at wages approved by the Government.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Approved Immigrants.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Approved immigrants can obtain a passage to
    any port in Queensland at the following rates:—Males, 12 years and
    upwards, £7; females, 12 years and upwards, £3; immigrants’ children
    (1 year and under 12 years), £1 10s. Maximum age: Males, married
    women, and widows, 45 years; single women, 35 years.
  </p>

    refunded to the immigrant on arrival. In the case of families applying
    for passages as assisted immigrants, one deposit only covers the whole
    family.

  <h3 class="left">Fruit.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Both tropical, sub-tropical, and deciduous fruits do well.
    Thirty years ago out of every 100 cases of oranges imported into
    Queensland 95 came from New South Wales. Now the citrus fruit industry
    has grown to such an extent that Queensland does not import 5 per
    cent., but has become a big exporter to Southern centres.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Pineapples.</h3>
  <p class="left">Pineapples grow all the year round in Queensland.</p>

  <h3 class="left">Where are Fruits Principally Grown?</h3>

    Cereals, root crops, fodder
    plants, tobacco, cotton, English and sub-tropical fruits in the South.
    Sugar-cane, bananas, coffee, tobacco, cotton, and tropical products in
    the North. Wool on the Darling Downs and the great grazing districts
    west of the Main Range.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

  <h3 class="left">What is the Mean Annual Rainfall?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    It varies considerably. Along the
    Pacific slope it runs approximately from 48 inches at Brisbane to
    150 inches in the Far North. West of the Great Dividing Range the
    rainfall diminishes from 30 inches to about 10 inches, according to
    the distance from the Main Range.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What is the Climate Like?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    The climate of Queensland is the most perfect winter season in the
    world.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">But is not the Heat Great in Summer?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Although there are occasional
    hot days, the summer season is not unpleasant. The mean summer
    temperatures are:—South Queensland, from 66.5 to 76.7; Central, 80.5;
    South-western, 80.8; North, 81.2; North-western, 84.3.
  </p>

  <p class="left">
    The death-rate in Queensland in 1913 was only 10.39 per 1,000.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">But does the Climate Suit English and European People?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes. They live to a great age in the genial atmosphere of
    Queensland.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What Sort of People are already Settled in Queensland?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Scotch, Irish,
    English, Welsh, Germans, Danes, Italians, Swedes, Russians, and other
    people of White nationalities. Russians, Swedes, and Danes make
    splendid colonists, and are warmly welcomed.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Do People Often Return after Leaving Queensland?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes. Men who go home
    with the intention of spending the rest of their lives in England are
    constantly returning to Queensland.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What Openings are there in Queensland for the Investor?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    There are
    numerous avenues of investment in sheep and cattle stations, farming

    of rubber.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

  <h3 class="left">For the Man with Small Capital on Government Land?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    With £150 to £200 a
    man can start dairying in a small way, and gradually increase his herd
    and operations. A good deal, of course, depends on the man.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Suppose he had £250 or £300?</h3>
  <p class="left">He could make a good start with that.</p>

  <h3 class="left">Suppose he tried Fruit Growing?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    With about £100 he could make a start.
    He could grow vegetables and minor crops until his trees grew old
    enough to bear, which would be in about three years from planting.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What could a Man do without Capital?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    He could work for a station-owner
    or farmer until he had made enough to pay his deposit on the land he
    eventually selects.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Experienced Agricultural Labourers.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    There is a great demand for this class.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Inexperienced Men.</h3>

  <p class="left">Over the age of 16 years.</p>

  <h3 class="left">Can a Man with Little Capital acquire Land?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes. If he pays the first
    deposit, the Crown may defer payment of the next three years’ rent.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">When is this Payable?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    It is divided over the fifth to the thirteenth year with interest
    at 4 per cent. per annum.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Can a Single Woman hold Government Land?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes; with the exception of a homestead area, if she is over 16
    years.

  <p class="left">
    A married woman is not competent to select an agricultural
    homestead, a grazing homestead, free homestead, perpetual lease
    selection, agricultural farm, or prickly-pear selection, subject to
    the conditions of personal residence, unless she has obtained an
    order for judicial separation, or an order protecting her separate
    property.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Married Women’s Property Act. </h3>
  <p class="left">
    Under “<i>The Married Women’s Property Act, 1890</i>,” she can hold
    any land, which she purchases absolutely, as if she were a man.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What are the Modes of Tenure?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      (1) Agricultural selection—i.e., agricultural farms, agricultural
      homesteads, perpetual lease selections, and free homesteads.
    </li>
    <li>
     (2) Grazing selections—i.e., grazing farms and grazing homesteads.

  <p class="left">
    Twenty years are allowed in
    which to pay for an agricultural farm. No interest is charged.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Annual Instalment. </h3>
  <p class="left">
    The annual instalment is 6d. in the £1—that is,
    2-1/2 per cent., or 3d. per acre on 10s. land; 6d. per acre on £1
    land; 1s. per acre on £2 land. The whole of this goes to principal.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Completing the Purchase.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    At above rate, in twenty years the farm is
    half paid for, and during that time the farmer has had the use of the
    farm for much less than a fair rental. At the end of the twenty-first
    year, he is expected to pay the remaining half. Taking money as worth
    5 per cent., this is equivalent to selling the land at half the
    proclaimed price.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Deposit Money.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    On an agricultural farm, agricultural homestead,
    perpetual lease selection, grazing selection, and unconditional

    2-1/2 per cent. per annum is allowed.

    with practically no restriction as to area. Terms up to thirty years.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Occupation Licenses.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Large areas may be rented from the Government
    from year to year under an occupation license. No limitation to area.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Group Settlement.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Under special conditions families from the same
    community are allowed to settle in groups so as to permit of their
    retaining their social relations.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Size of Groups.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Groups of from six families to as many as seventy
    families have already been successfully formed.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Inspection.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    It is a good plan for friends to club together to pay the
    expenses of one of their number to go to Queensland to find land for a
    “group” to accommodate them all.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Miners’ Homestead Leases.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Under the provisions of “<i>The Miners’ Homestead Leases Act of
    1913</i>,” homestead leases can be acquired by
    application, or by tender or public auction by residents of any mining
    field throughout the State, in areas not exceeding 640 acres. During
    the first period of thirty years the annual rental on areas up to 40
    acres is 1s. per acre, and 6d. for any additional acreage in excess
    of this area. This rental does not, of course, apply to homesteads
    acquired by tender or sale. After the expiration of the thirty years’
    lease a nominal rental of 1s. only can be demanded. The minimum annual
    rental for any homestead is 5s.

  <h3 class="left">Can an Alien select Land in Queensland?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes, provided he obtains a
    certificate to the effect that he can read and write words in such
    language as the Minister for Lands may direct; also provided that
    he becomes a naturalised British subject within five years of his
    selecting the land, failing which he will forfeit all his right,
    title, and interest in the land selected.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What is an Alien?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Any person who is not a British subject. For
    instance, Americans, Frenchmen, Swedes, Italians, Russians, &amp;c.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">When can an Alien become Naturalised?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    After he has been at least
    two years in the Commonwealth of Australia, he may take the oath
    of allegiance, become a Britisher, and enjoy all the freedom and
    privileges appertaining thereto.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Where must Applications for Land be Lodged?</h3>
  <p class="left">At the local Land Office.</p>

  <h3 class="left">How far from the Railway is the Available Land?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Most of the land is
    not far from existing lines. The policy of the Government, however,
    is to build light railway lines (as feeders to the main lines) to tap
    agricultural districts, and to anticipate settlement.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Light Railway Lines Opening Large Areas.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Some of these short lines which it is proposed to build will open
    up an immense area of good land.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Crown Lands at Auction.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Crown lands may be acquired in fee-simple by
    auction purchase in limited areas as town and suburban lots.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Price.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    The minimum purchasing price for land bought at auction is 10s.
    per acre.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

  <h3 class="left"></h3>
  <p class="left">
    Terms of Purchase. Terms up to ten years may be allowed, with interest
    at 5 per cent. per annum.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What Assistance does the Government Give the Intending Settler?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    The
    Government issues a railway ticket at half the ordinary fare to the
    intending settler desirous of inspecting Crown land with a view of
    selecting an area not exceeding 5,120 acres. If the intending settler
    subsequently takes up a selection, subject to personal residence
    conditions, not exceeding 5,120 acres in area, the half-fare paid by
    him is refunded, and his family, self, ordinary household furniture
    and effects, agricultural implements, seed, one dray, and one set
    of harness are carried free to the railway station nearest to his
    selection.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What Other Assistance?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Special reduced rates are granted for the
    carriage of building material, fencing wire, and two truckloads of
    live stock. Wire netting is also supplied on twenty years’ terms at 5
    per cent. per annum.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Assistance to Obtain Water.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    If desired, the State will also sink wells
    on waterless country, spreading the cost over the total purchase price
    of the land over the term of lease.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What is the Agricultural Bank?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    A Government Bank institution
    established, primarily, for the purpose of assisting new settlers
    and also agriculturists and graziers, to whom it makes advances on
    the security of freeholds, licenses, and leases from the Crown, for
    the purpose of making improvements on the land or for paying off
    liabilities, at 5 per cent. per annum, repayable in twenty-five years
    or at any time at the option of the borrower.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

  <h3 class="left">What Security is Required?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    The applicant for an advance must give a
    first mortgage on his holding. The bank advances 12s. in the £1 on the
    total value of the land and improvements.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">When is it Repayable?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    For the first five years only simple interest is
    charged at 5 per cent. per annum. After five years the borrower must
    begin to redeem his advance at the rate of £4 0s. 3d. half-yearly for
    each £100 borrowed, inclusive of interest, until the whole has been
    paid.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Can the Settler Borrow Money to Buy Stock?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes. The Agricultural
    Bank will advance 12s. in the £1 of the total value of the land and
    improvements for the purpose of purchasing stock, machinery, or
    implements the selector desires to purchase, or for relieving the
    liability on the holding. Advances at the rate of 13s. 4d. in the £1
    on the value of the land and improvements thereon up to £200 can also
    be obtained for unspecified purposes.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Can an Alien Obtain an Advance? </h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes, provided he obtains a certificate
    to the effect that he can read and write words in such language as the
    Minister for Lands may direct; also provided he becomes a naturalised
    British subject within five years of his selecting the land.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Workers’ Dwellings Act.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Under the provisions of this Act the
    Government make advances, on easy terms of repayment, for the purpose
    of enabling persons of small incomes to erect dwelling-houses as homes
    for themselves and their families. The applicant must show that his
    income does not exceed £200 per annum, and that he is not the owner of
    a dwelling-house in Queensland or elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

  <h3 class="left">Freeholds Farm.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Plenty of good freehold farms change hands from
    time to time in Queensland at from £3 to £20 per acre. Settlers not
    desirous of taking up Government land can easily be suited privately.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What is the Nature of the Soil?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    It varies with the locality. All
    of the Northern and Eastern scrub lands are intensely fertile with
    vegetable mould. The Darling Downs contains 4,000,000 acres of
    magnificent black soil, principally decomposed basalt. The soil in
    the Maranoa district is lighter and more suited to wheat-growing and
    vines. These descriptions apply pretty generally to the whole of
    Queensland, particularly the Central Districts.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Who are the most Successful Farmers?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Those who carry on mixed farming,
    such as dairying, agriculture, sheep, pig and poultry raising,
    horticulture and bee-farming, &amp;c.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Do many of the Farmers Keep Sheep? </h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes; many of them now go in for
    lamb-raising on lucerne. There are also a number of selectors who have
    sheep on areas of from 640 to 4,000 acres.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Is Dairying Increasing in Queensland?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes, every day; and nearly all the dairy farmers are independent men.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">How much Milk was Obtained in 1913?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    90,545,516 gallons. Quantity
    utilised for making butter, 73,582,041 gallons; for cheese, 5,268,447
    gallons; for condensed milk, 2,131,382 gallons; sold for domestic
    purposes, 4,178,758 gallons; and 5,384,888 gallons used on farms.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">How did these Dairymen Begin?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Most of them began in a very small way,
    buying a cow now and again as they could afford it.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

  <h3 class="left">Were they all Small Farmers?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes, for the most part. The larger
    farmers have also taken up dairying in addition to wheat, maize,
    barley, lucerne, and oat growing.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What was the Butter Production in Queensland in 1913?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    35,199,387 lb., valued at £1,613,305.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Cheese, 1913?</h3>
  <p class="left">5,395,050 lb., valued at £141,400.</p>

  <h3 class="left">Condensed Milk made in 1913?</h3>
  <p class="left">8,059,051 lb., valued at £187,536.</p>

  <h3 class="left">What will a Good Average Cow Earn?</h3>
  <p class="left">From 15s. to 30s. per month.</p>

  <h3 class="left">What is the Price of a Good Cow?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    From £5 to £8. Of course some well-bred cows fetch a much higher
    figure.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">What is the Class of Dairy Herd in Queensland?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Dairy stock have
    been imported to Queensland from the principal herds of the world,
    and a splendid class of cow is now in use, comprising the following
    breeds:—Milking Shorthorn, Ayrshire, Holstein, Guernsey, and Jersey.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">How many Cows does the Average Farm Carry?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    It all depends on the size
    of the holding. There are many large properties in Queensland milking
    several hundred cows daily throughout the year. The average herd is
    about 20, but many farmers milk from 80 to 150 daily.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">How many Cows could you Carry on 160 Acres?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    With good land, mixed
    farming, and by growing crops and conserving fodder, you could carry
    30 to 40 at a low estimate. Some 160 acres cleared scrub farms carry
    70 to 80 cows.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

  <h3 class="left">Monthly Cheques.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Suppliers to the factories are paid monthly by
    cheque, and some draw £100 and over per month for milk and cream.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Pigs.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Pig-raising is now considered to be a part of dairying, and is
    very profitable. The climate is particularly suited to pigs, and no
    housing is required.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Pig Farms.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    On some holdings large mobs of young pigs are grazed on
    barley or alfalfa (lucerne), and topped up in batches in large sties.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Market for Pigs.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    There is a certain market for pigs in Brisbane,
    Toowoomba, &amp;c., where there are bacon-curing establishments.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Wheat.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Wheat is sown (late maturing varieties) in March and April, and
    (quick maturing varieties) in May, June, and July. Harvesting extends
    from October to early in December.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Where Wheat is Principally Grown.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    In Southern Queensland. It can also
    be grown in the Central-western districts of Queensland.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Wheat Yield.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Crops of 20 to 30 bushels to the acre are commonly reaped
    in the best wheat-growing districts of Queensland. Forty bushels per
    acre have often been obtained in individual instances.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Maize.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Maize is planted in July and August right up to January, and is
    fit for harvesting in 120 days. It can be grown all over Queensland,
    where the rainfall is sufficient. Two crops a year are possible in
    sub-tropical scrub and coastal country.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

  <h3 class="left">Maize Yield.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Immense yields of maize, from 40 to 80 bushels per acre,
    are frequently obtained on the rich scrub lands. Yields of 120 bushels
    per acre have also been obtained.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Barley.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Barley does particularly well on the Darling Downs, where the
    quality of the crop for malting purposes is held by English experts to
    equal the best Hungarian. Crops of from 30 to 40 bushels are frequent
    in a good season.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Sugarcane.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Sugarcane growing is carried on along the coastal area from
    Brisbane northwards. It is planted from January to June; 2,085,588
    tons of sugarcane were produced in 1913.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Price Paid for Cane.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Prices for cane vary according to its
    sugar-producing properties and the locality in which it is grown.
    These, however, range from 20s. to 27s. per ton. Crops of from 40 to
    even 70 tons per acre have been obtained in the North.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Hay.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Hay averaged about 1-3/4 tons to the acre for the last twenty
    years. Individual crops yield much heavier results.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Potatoes.</h3>
  <p class="left">Both English and sweet potatoes give heavy yields.</p>

  <h3 class="left">Lucerne or Alfalfa.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    This is one of the best crops a farmer can grow in
    Southern Queensland. Once planted, it lasts from seven to ten years.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Lucerne Crops.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    The roots of lucerne have been known to penetrate the
    soil for a depth of 30 ft. In a good year five to six cuttings can be
    obtained. Ten cuttings per annum are often obtained around Laidley,
    Southern Queensland.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Can a Man get any Crop with his First Ploughing?</h3>
  <p class="left">Yes. Wheat or Maize.</p>

  <h3 class="left">What First Crop can be got off Scrub Land?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    The method is to fell the
    scrub, and, after it has dried, put a fire through it. Maize is then
    put in with a hoe between the stumps. Some crops up to 85 bushels per
    acre have been garnered in this way.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <h3 class="left">State Agricultural College.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    There is a State Agricultural College at
    Gatton, South Queensland, where students can undergo a three years’
    training at a cost of under £30 per annum.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Are there any other State Experimental Farms?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Yes. At Hermitage, near
    Warwick; Roma, South-western Queensland; Warren, near Rockhampton;
    Gindie, near Emerald; Kairi, Atherton district (North Queensland); and
    at Kamerunga, near Cairns (North Queensland); Sugar Experiment Station
    and Laboratory, Mackay (North Queensland); and experimental plots in
    all the principal sugar districts.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">House and Buildings.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    At first a farmer generally erects a rough, cheap
    building of materials cut on the place at a cost of a few pounds, and
    when matters improve puts up a more suitable dwelling.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Where can Building Materials be Obtained?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Iron and wood can be
    obtained in any part of Queensland. Competition among the timber
    merchants is so keen that timber can be procured at a small cost. A
    small comfortable cottage can be built for about £100 upwards.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Do Droughts Often Occur?</h3>
  <p class="left">
    The last drought was in 1902, and even
    then there were parts of Queensland not affected by it. Droughts do
    not, as a rule, affect the whole country, and with extended railway
    communication relief country will be available.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Recuperative Power of the Land.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    The recuperative power of the land is
    marvellous. A fortnight after summer rain (following a dry spell) the
    country is waving with grasses. Owing to the mild climate, the growth
    is phenomenal.
  </p>

  <p class="left"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

  <h3 class="left">Local Markets.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    Farmers can readily dispose of all they can grow in the
    local markets, where competition amongst buyers is keen.
  </p>

  <h3 class="left">Southern Markets.</h3>
  <p class="left">
    There is a certain market in the South for all
    Queensland produce.

    <i>Some Successful Queensland Farmers.</i>
  </h2>
  <hr class="full" />

  <p class="normal">
    During a recent tour through Queensland the Compiler was enabled to
    obtain the practical experiences of a large number of new and old
    settlers on the fertile areas in this land of great possibilities and
    substantial realities. The cases cited here will serve to illustrate
    what the men on the land in the districts visited are doing to
    develop the agricultural resources of the country. Despite that the
    new settlers were faced with many difficulties at the outset, they,
    by indomitable pluck, determination, and perseverance, succeeded in
    conquering the dense scrubs and mountain fastnesses, and converting
    them into wealth-producing agricultural homesteads. Many of these
    settlers started with only a few pounds in their pocket, but they had
    what money cannot buy—stout hearts, courage, and energy. To-day quite
    a number of these have turned the corner of adversity into the highway
    of success, and are reaping the fruits of their labours.
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">A Successful Mixed Farmer.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    In the Springsure district (Central Queensland) Mr. M. T. Bourke is
    one of the most successful dairymen and mixed farmers. His dairy herd
    consists of pure-bred Shorthorns and pedigreed bulls. On an average he
    milks 88 cows once daily during the year, and these are fed on natural
    pastures. Last year he obtained 19,094 gallons of milk, and 9,339 lb.
    of cream produced 2,649 lb. of commercial butter. In April, 1913,
    1,039 lb. of cream sent to one of the Rockhampton factories returned
    over 576 lb. of commercial butter. His year’s transactions in pigs
    realised £91 12s.; turkeys, £27 3s.; fowls, £2 10s. 8d.; eggs (317
    dozen), £16; fat bullocks, 400 at £7 per head; horses (artillery and
    draught), £626 10s. Several of the horses brought from £26 to £28 per
    head.
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">What the Daniels Family are Doing.</h3>
  <p class="normal">
    The Daniels family, which numbers no less than eight distinct
    branches, are also very successful mixed farmers in the Gindie
    district (Central Queensland). Their opera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>tions comprise
    wheat-growing, dairying, sheep-breeding, &amp;c. In 1913 they had about
    250 acres under wheat.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. T. C. Daniels gives the following particulars in regard to the
    cultivation and harvesting of wheat:—“The first ploughing,” he says,
    “will cost 15s. per acre, but afterwards it will only be 5s. for the
    same area. Other expenditure includes: Seed wheat, about 8s. per acre;
    cultivating after first ploughing, 2s. 6d. per acre; harvesting with
    reaper and binder, 5s. per acre; carting and stooking, 5s. per acre;
    total expenditure, £1 5s. 6d. per acre. The cost of cutting a ton of
    chaff is about £1 5s., and bags are 8d. each. His crop averaged 30
    cwt. to the acre, and he received £6 10s. per ton for his wheaten
    chaff on the rails at Gindie Station.”
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">Started with £100.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    In the course of an interview, Mr. J. Edminstone, of Craigend Farm,
    Belmont Pocket, near Rockhampton (Central Queensland), gave some
    information which should be invaluable to intending settlers in
    Queensland. Mr. Edminstone is, at the present time, one of the most
    prosperous dairymen in the State.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “A labouring man,” Mr. Edminstone said, “could easily earn about
    £200 a year at farming in Queensland. I have made that myself. I had
    experience on a farm in the old country, but that is not absolutely
    necessary.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “I consider farming is the best thing for new settlers to turn their
    attention to in Queensland.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “I would recommend a man to take up dairy farming. Cows can be bought
    for about £4 to £7 each. Then you can buy good dairy land for about
    £1 per acre. You have long terms, about twenty years, to pay for
    your land, and the payments are not equal to a good rent in the old
    country. When a man has got his land he can grow plenty of feed for
    his cattle for the few months of the winter, when they have to be fed
    on account of the pastures being dry. During the rest of the year his
    cattle find their food in the natural grasses of his pastures.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “A man could easily make a good start here with about £150. That money
    would be used for paying the first
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> instalment on his land purchase,
    buying a few cows, and putting up his house. Of course, a pioneer
    doesn’t spend much on his house at first, until he has made some money.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “I began with £100 about fifteen years ago. I have paid for my land
    some time since, and I reckon that at the present time I am worth
    about £2,000 in land and stock.”
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. Edminstone milks, as a rule, 90 cows during the year, and each of
    these earn, on an average, 20s. per month. The highest return from
    one cow was 27s. per month. The cows are fed on the natural grasses
    only. In January last 105 grade Ayrshires, Shorthorns, and Jerseys
    earned £121; February—115 cows, £111; March—105 cows, £101; April—100
    cows, £104; May—90 cows, £66; June—75 cows, £55; July—60 cows, £58.
    Mr. Edminstone has, according to his books, been receiving similar
    satisfactory returns from his milking herd for many years past. Pig
    raising and general farming also claims a great deal of his attention,
    and the annual returns from these sources are highly satisfactory.
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">New Settlers’ Experiences.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. C. W. L. Bryde, who has taken up a selection in the parish of
    Dambulla, near Lake Barrine, Atherton, North Queensland, about
    two years ago, is satisfied that his new home has been pitched in
    “the garden of Australia.” He was born in Liverpool, England, and,
    adopting the sea as a profession, reached the position of chief mate.
    Several severe trips between Newcastle and Valparaiso with coal for
    the Chilian Government cooled off his ardour for the sea, and, faced
    with nervous breakdown, he was attracted to North Queensland. He took
    up his selection, and threw himself with enthusiasm into his new
    employment. Mr. Bryde says that the soil is extraordinarily rich, and
    it is quite clear that the district has a great future. Permanent
    creeks abound everywhere, and on his holding there are seven streams
    carrying crystal water. Chokos, pumpkins, and piemelons, the seeds
    of which were dropped, grew wild, and the scrubs contain scores of
    passion-fruit vines. At present the timber does not pay to market,
    though it is only eight miles from Kulara, on the Tolga-Johnstone
    line; but if the railway from this point to Mobo, via Lake Barrine,

    were constructed, cedar patches and other timbers, such as red and
    white beech, kauri, and silky oak, would be made available. Mr. Bryde
    has seen the Richmond River, and he considers that the land in his
    neighbourhood is superior. But he states that it is of no use for any
    one to go in for land there unless he is willing to rough it.

  <p class="normal">
    A Victorian (Mr. Herbert C. West), who settled at Eurobin Park,
    Jandowae, in the Dalby district (Southern Queensland), about two years
    ago, is also satisfied with his experiences in Queensland. Writing
    to the Department of Lands, he said:—“We have just had a delightful
    rainfall, and my lucerne, maize, and other green crops are looking
    well. This is a splendid district, and I am more than satisfied with
    my adopted country.”

    Had a Stout Heart, Strong Pair of Hands, and Plenty of Pluck and
    Determination.
  </h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. J. McLellan, of Miriam Vale, in the Gladstone district (Central
    Queensland), stated that he started as an agriculturist sixteen years
    ago with a stout heart, a strong pair of hands, plenty of pluck and
    determination, and 6s. per day while he was working on the railway
    line. His frugality enabled him to save money out of his wages to buy
    a couple of head of cattle at a time. In his spare moments he cleared
    his land, and got it ready for its first crop. After a little time
    he devoted the whole of his exertions to his farm, with the result
    that he soon became independent of outside employment. That he has
    become a successful man is abundantly proved by the fact that he is
    now enjoying a trip to Scotland. As a dairyman and general farmer, Mr.
    McLellan can hold his own with any one in the State.

  <h3 class="center">Successful Efforts from Small Beginnings.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    In the Barmoya Scrub, Rockhampton district (Central Queensland), a
    good percentage of the recent settlers had very small beginnings, but
    now they are fairly well off. Mr. J. Kersey (a carpenter) had a horse
    and cart and £7; Mr. A. T. Vaisey (formerly an employee in a New
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
    Zealand flax mill) had £75; Mr. F. W. A. Broszat (a bricklayer), £250;
    Mr. Reuben Johnson (a shift boss on Mount Morgan Mine), £100. All are
    well satisfied with their lot. The German settlers, of whom there are
    a large number, frankly admit that they are contented, and say that
    one and all have splendid opportunities to become prosperous, but they
    must be prepared to work hard to attain this object.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. R. Johnson is one of the most prosperous settlers in this
    district. He was one of the first to settle in the district about
    ten years ago, and he has had no reason to regret it. He milks on
    an average 42 cows of the grade Jersey strain daily, and each beast
    returns him about 15s. per month regularly. The herd includes a
    pure-bred Jersey bull and cow. There are 130 acres under Rhodes grass
    and 7 acres under maize and pumpkins. Mr. Johnson has done wonders
    in the short time that he has been in the district, and his efforts
    should prove a strong incentive to others to do likewise.
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">Started as a Farm Labourer.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    In the Bushley district, near Rockhampton (Central Queensland), Mr.
    E. Holland has a splendid farm of about 3,000 acres on Sandy Creek.
    He states that he started farming with little or no money. Soon after
    his arrival from England he found employment as a farm labourer, and
    accepted cattle as payment for his work. A year or so later he took
    up a 160-acre block at a rental of 2s. 6d. per acre, and then started
    dairying. As years went by he acquired further areas, and increased
    his operations to such an extent that he is now one of the most
    successful settlers in Central Queensland. His dairy herd is made
    up of grade Shorthorns and a pedigreed Shorthorn bull, and totals
    500. On an average 80 cows are milked once a day during the year.
    The young steers are fattened up and sold to the butchers when about
    twelve months old. Last year (1913) he sold thirty-six of these at
    £3 10s. per head. Horses (light draughts and saddle) are also bred.
    He also finds time for raising Berkshire and Yorkshire pigs. There
    are 35 acres under cultivation—4 acres lucerne and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> 31 acres rotation
    crops—wheat, oats, rye, panicum, &amp;c. Mr. Holland is also a maker
    of Cheshire cheese of splendid flavour, but his operations in this
    respect are only on a small scale.
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">Had a Horse and Saddle and 3s. 6d.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. J. T. Alexander, of Glenlyon Farm, Dalma, near Rockhampton
    (Central Queensland), arrived in Queensland from New South Wales in
    1887, with a horse and saddle and 3s. 6d. in his pocket. At first
    he engaged in droving, then was a stockman on a station, and later
    manager of several cattle runs. Seven years ago he purchased 3,000
    acres of the Glenlyon Estate, which consisted of open forest country.
    Then he turned his attention to the breeding of dairy and beef cattle
    and Border-Leicester sheep. He is getting £5 per head for 2-year-old
    steers, £3 for 12-month-old steers, and £4 15s. for 3-year-old
    heifers. The area under cultivation totals 14 acres—barley 4 acres,
    lucerne 2 acres, maize 2 acres, panicum 4 acres, sweet potatoes 2
    acres. He has 150 head of beef cattle, and a small dairy herd of grade
    Jerseys.

  <h3 class="center">Fruit-grower Starts with £5.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    After paying for his freehold of 21 acres, Mr. A. Neale, of Parkhurst,
    North Rockhampton (Central Queensland), had only about £5 in cash,
    three horses, and a few agricultural implements. By dint of hard work
    he cleared his land of the forest, planted it with fruit trees, and in
    a couple of years he gathered his first crops. Later he erected his
    present home. To-day he is in a comfortable position, due entirely
    to fruit-growing. In all 5 acres are under fruits of different
    kinds. Citrus fruits, which number 300 trees, are most generally
    grown. Grapes, peaches, papaws, loquats, plums, and mangoes are also
    cultivated. In 1913 citrus fruits returned £250, grapes £130, and
    other crops, £30. He milks a few cows of the Shorthorn-Hereford cross
    for his own wants, and pigs are bred for a like purpose. Poultry and
    vegetables are annually raised for market. Mr. Neale is a strong
    advocate of dry farming.

  <h3 class="center">Had only a Few Shillings left after Paying the First Year’s Rent.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Quite a number of the new settlers in the Woodend and Bushley Scrubs,
    in the Rockhampton district (Central Queensland), started in a small
    way, and are now in very comfortable circumstances. The Lehfeldt
    Brothers were formerly employed as labourers at the Mount Morgan
    Mine. In 1895 they selected 160 acres, and after paying the first
    year’s rent (£5 15s.) had only a few shillings left. When they had
    finished fencing the land and clearing portion of it, they arranged to
    supply the Mount Morgan Mine with firewood. By this means they made
    sufficient money to acquire a further 160 acres for £100 cash, and
    effect more substantial improvements on their holdings. Farming was
    begun in real earnest in 1906, and since then success has attended
    their efforts. Last year the Messrs. Lehfeldt took up another block
    of 160 acres at a rental of 20s. per acre. They have 328 acres under
    cultivation—20 acres lucerne, 90 acres maize, 170 acres Rhodes grass,
    40 acres paspalum, 5 acres panicum, 3 acres English potatoes. Last
    year (1913) they averaged 110 bushels of maize to the acre from a
    10-acre plot, and annexed the championship for Central Queensland.
    Patches of sugarcane and cotton are also grown. The dairy herd
    comprises 20 grade Ayrshires and a pure-bred Ayrshire bull. It is
    their intention to increase their operations in dairying at an early
    date. Pigs are being profitably raised, likewise light draught and
    saddle horses. The Messrs. Lehfeldt have one of the best conducted
    farms in the State.

  <h3 class="center">Mining Engineer—Now a Successful Fruit-grower, &amp;c.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. J. T. Coates, of Harveston, Rockhampton (Central Queensland), was
    formerly a mining engineer before he took up 327 acres on the bank
    of the Fitzroy River. He has 10 acres under fruits—1,100 papaws, 150
    citrus (including oranges, limes, lemons, cumquots), 500 grape vines,
    50 custard apples, 20 mangoes, also figs, bananas, apples, pears,
    peaches, quinces, persimmons, pineapples, granadillas, &amp;c. There are
    also 30 acres under lucerne, 11 acres of Japanese millet, and 5 acres
    of sweet potatoes. White Leghorns and Black Orpingtons of pure strains
    are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> largely raised, the former by the thousands. Mr. Coates also pays
    much attention to dairying, and his herd of grade Shorthorns give good
    returns monthly. Although his fruit trees only started to bear last
    year his returns in this direction amounted to £150. From poultry and
    eggs he received £150, dairying £101, chaff £180, and miscellaneous
    £35. The total receipts from all sources were £616. Last year Mr.
    Coates paid away over £400 in wages.
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">Inexperience no Obstacle to Success.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Among the new settlers in the Stanwell district (Central Queensland)
    are quite a number who started with limited capital, and no previous
    experience in farming. Mr. T. P. Connor was a miner, and had £500. Not
    only is he dairying, growing crops, and raising pigs, but he is also
    breeding beef cattle and horses with much success. Messrs. J. Thomas
    (stockman) and J. Todman (miner) started with £250, and are now doing
    well out of general farming, dairying, pig-raising, &amp;c. Portion of
    the farm is irrigated, the water being lifted by a pump from Neerkol
    Creek, and conveyed in galvanised iron piping to the cultivation
    areas. They estimate the cost to irrigate an acre at 8s., exclusive of
    their own labour. Mr. W. H. Teakel (a Victorian farmer) started with
    £400, and says that he is doing better than he did in Victoria. Every
    year he is getting good crops of maize, lucerne, wheat, pumpkins,
    potatoes, &amp;c. He has a small herd of grade Ayrshires, and a few pigs.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    The Plunkett family have been farming for three years, and are
    getting splendid returns from their farming operations. They have a
    fairly large area under maize, lucerne, potatoes, &amp;c., milk 15 grade
    Ayrshires daily, and breed horses and pigs for market. Mr. Plunkett
    paid £1,400 for the farm of 411 acres as a going concern for his sons.

  <h3 class="center">Had no Previous Agricultural Experience.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. W. J. Barber selected 640 acres of dense vine scrub and brigalow
    country a few miles from Banana (Central Queensland) in 1913 at 10s.
    per acre. He came from Young (New South Wales), with £190, and had no
    previous experience of agricultural life. About 46 acres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> of the scrub
    have been cleared and planted with Rhodes grass and maize, the latter
    being sown with the aid of a hand planter. From 30 to 40 acres more
    scrub are being cleared, and will be put under cultivation when it is
    ready. The first year’s outlay on the farm amounted to about £190.
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">Made a Start with £150.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. Peter Jensen started in the Banana district (Central Queensland)
    with £150 by taking up 880 acres, a little over a year ago, at 10s.
    per acre. The country comprises brigalow scrub and open downs. He has
    cleared 50 acres, and put in Rhodes grass and maize. A further 50
    acres is to be cleared, and planted with Rhodes grass and maize. Mr.
    Jensen’s first crop of maize of 34 acres yielded 900 bushels.

    Mr. Charles Roderick is one of the pioneers of the agricultural
    industry in the Banana district, Central Queensland. He has 1,280
    acres of land, for which he paid 10s. per acre. In addition to raising
    crops, Mr. Roderick is engaging in dairying and pig raising. Last
    year he obtained 840 bushels of maize from 33 acres. This year he has
    27 acres under maize, and 33 acres of Rhodes grass. Mr. Roderick was
    previously a publican.
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">Landed in the District with £200.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. C. G. Young selected 136 acres at Deeford, in the Dawson Valley
    country, Central Queensland, in 1912. Previously he was a commercial
    traveller in Sydney. When he landed in the district he had £200. After
    clearing the dense vine scrub from his farm, he planted 24 acres with
    maize, Rhodes grass, and pumpkins. The price paid for the Crown land
    was 50s. per acre. Mr. Young estimates his first year’s expenditure
    at slightly over £100. Dairying and pig-raising on a small scale is
    carried on. This young farmer stated he was well satisfied with his
    prospects.

    Mr. E. Stevens, of Deeford, in the Dawson Valley (Central Queensland),
    came from Tasmania nearly two years ago, with £600. His farm consists
    of 174 acres, of which 65 acres have been cleared of the dense scrub,
    and planted with maize and Rhodes grass. He intends to give dairying
    some of his attention at an early date. The first year’s operations

  </p>

  <h3 class="center">Miner Starts Farming with £50.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. C. F. Holton, who was a miner by occupation, took up 160 acres at
    Grantleigh, in the Gogango district (Central Queensland), seven years
    ago. At the time he had only £50 in his pocket. For a couple of years
    he undertook to cut timber for the Mount Morgan Mine, and also worked
    on the selections of several of his neighbours. By this means he made
    sufficient money to enable him to start farming on his own account.
    To-day he is making a profit of over £100 annually by growing lucerne,
    maize, potatoes, &amp;c. Last year he obtained from 65 to 70 bushels to
    the acre from his crop of maize, and his lucerne yields from five
    to six cuttings annually. Berkshire and Yorkshire pigs are bred on
    a small scale. Among other crops grown are Rhodes grass, millets,
    barley, cowpea, pumpkins, and grapes. In partnership with Mr. H.
    Gates, he has acquired a prickly-pear selection of 640 acres on the
    opposite side of the line. The pear, which is very thick, is being
    eradicated by burning. It takes two men a day to clear two acres.
    About 150 acres of this property is to be planted with wheat, oats,
    English potatoes, and fruits of various kinds.

  <h3 class="center">Queensland—The Finest Agricultural Country in Australia.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. Robert Laver, a Victorian farmer, together with his nine sons,
    took up 13,000 acres under the group system in the Gogango Scrub
    (Central Queensland) five years ago. They have now 3,000 acres
    cleared, and 500 acres under cultivation, 400 acres being under Rhodes
    grass. The other crops are:—Maize, 30 acres; lucerne, 50 acres;
    cowpea, 5 acres; pumpkins (planted in the same area with the maize),
    30 acres. Citrus fruits and grapes are also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> grown on a small scale.
    Last year 10 acres of oats and 9 acres of wheat averaged 2 tons of
    hay to the acre. Herefords, crossed by a Devon-Shorthorn strain of
    bull, are bred for the butcher every year. The dairy herd is composed
    of grade Shorthorns and Ayrshires, crossed by an Illawarra bull. The
    return from 20 to 40 cows for the year was 5,649 lb. of commercial
    butter. The 60 cows milked daily earn about 15s. per head per month.
    All the milking is done by machine. Last year 100 tons of oaten,
    wheaten, and lucerne chaff were sold at £4 10s. per ton. The Laver
    family also devote much attention to pig raising. A few years ago
    they bred pure-bred Lincolns, and in 1912 fattened 27 merinos on an
    acre of rape. The land is of a rich chocolate nature, and is watered
    by Gogango Creek, several lagoons, and the Fitzroy River. Steps are
    to be taken at an early date to irrigate the farms by lifting the
    water from the river by means of a pump, and then adopting natural
    gravitation. The Laver family, who started with plenty of money, are
    in a position to carry on their operations on a large scale. They
    estimate the cost of clearing their scrub land at £3 per acre. They
    state that Queensland, particularly the Gogango Scrub portion of it,
    is the finest agricultural country in the Commonwealth. The climate,
    too, cannot be equalled.

  <h3 class="center">A Well-known Grazier’s Opinion.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    The testimony of Mr. John Moffat, of Camoola Park, a well-known
    grazier in the Longreach district (Central Queensland), is of more
    than ordinary interest. Mr. Moffat says:—
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “There were never better opportunities than the present in Queensland
    for young men and women who have energy and ambition, and are not
    frightened of honest work. I came from Scotland when a baby with my
    parents (emigrants) during the fifties to Adelaide, South Australia.
    My father worked as a blacksmith, and afterwards as a carrier taking
    goods to the Victorian goldfields, and subsequently began farming in
    New South Wales. I had seven brothers and three sisters.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “I left home without a shilling, and took to shearing during the
    season, and did contract work at other times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> until I had enough
    money to select a half section (320 acres) in New South Wales. There
    I married, and in time increased my area sufficiently to carry on
    sheep-grazing and wheat-growing. In time I sold out to good advantage,
    and came to Queensland, where I am now a grazier. My brothers are all
    employers of labour. I have reared and educated three sons and two
    daughters. If I were a young man now with my usual health, I would not
    be afraid to start life again under similar circumstances and present
    conditions. I attribute my success to perseverance and ambition, and
    using the proceeds judiciously. Australia is a good field for any
    industrious man or woman who sets his or her mind to honest work and
    tries to give satisfaction, as there are employments to suit nearly
    all classes of labour, as also for a man of moderate means, to take
    up a small farm in a suitable locality, especially after getting some
    experience in one of the State Agricultural Colleges. I have been in
    the State now nearly twenty years, and consider it a very good field
    for emigrants.”

  <h3 class="center">Started Cane-growing with £147.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. Robert P. Sneesby started sugar-growing on the Maroochy River,
    North Coast Line (South Queensland), with only £147. Four years ago
    he arrived from the Clarence River (N.S.W.), where he was a dairyman
    and maize-grower. He took up 80 acres on the Maroochy River, for
    which he paid £8 per acre. This he cleared and cropped, and then
    sold for £1,800. Then he purchased his present holding of 153 acres
    of dense scrub, the price paid therefor being £4 5s. per acre. Other
    expenditure—House, 18 ft. x 24 ft., £30; plough, £4 10s.; harrows,
    £4 10s.; scuffler, £2 12s.; hoes, mattocks, spades, &amp;c., £1 10s.; 2
    horses, £50; harness, £8; slide for cane haulage, £1; total, £102 2s.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    Estimate per acre for getting land ready for first crop—Brushing,
    felling, burning, and clearing scrub, £4; holeing with mattock, £1
    17s. 6d.; plants, £1; planting, &amp;c., £1; chipping (3), £3 15s.; total,
    £11 12s. 6d.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    In 1912 he cut 215 tons of cane, and his crop of maize yielded 450
    bushels. From 12 acres of cane last season (1913) he harvested 370
    tons. The contract for cutting cane and haulage by punt across the
    river entailed an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> expenditure of 6s. 9d. per ton. Mr. Sneesby has
    also a dairy herd of twelve, consisting of grade Ayrshires and
    Shorthorns. Regularly every week he sends 13 gallons of cream to the
    Caboolture Butter Factory. A dairy and separator is also established
    on the farm. About 6 acres have been planted with bananas, 2 acres
    with pineapples, and 1 acre with citrons.

  <h3 class="center">Another Successful Sugar-cane Grower.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    One of the most successful growers in the Johnstone River district
    (North Queensland), is Mr. David Hunter, of Goondi. Prior to starting
    cane-growing eight years ago, he was overseer of labour for the
    Colonial Sugar Refining Company at Goondi. He started with very little
    capital, but the terms on which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company
    sold him land were so reasonable that he had no difficulty in not only
    meeting his engagements, but also making a profit out of his labours.
    Good cultivation and manuring with mill refuse were the reasons for
    his success. <em>His first season’s crop in 1906 yielded 1,820 tons,
    the net profit therefrom, after paying all liabilities, being 3s.
    4d. per ton. In 1907 he cut 1,910 tons, and realised a net profit of
    8s. per ton; in 1908, 1,861 tons, net profit, 10s. 11d. per ton; in
    1909, 2,134 tons, net profit 11s. 6d. per ton; in 1910, 92 acres
    yielded 2,832 tons, net profit 12s. 5d. per ton. </em> His average
    yield per acre for six years was 28 tons. In addition to mill refuse,
    he used green and dry manures to fertilise his land. He paid his
    permanent field workers 30s. per week and found. Yields for
    1911–12:—1911: 90 acres, 2,423 tons; 1912: 64 acres, 1,365 tons. The
    best yields per acre were 43 tons in 1910 and 40 tons in 1911.

  <h3 class="center">Arrived with an Empty Pocket.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. H. Denning, in responding to the toast of “The Pioneers,” at a
    banquet at Mount Tarampa, in the Lowood district (South Queensland)
    in 1913, said:—“It was now 35 years since he became a resident of
    the district. He arrived with an empty pocket, and on arrival found
    he was compelled to cut a road 1-1/2 miles through scrub to get to
    the boundary of his selection. He cleared 2 acres, and after six
    months harvested his first crop of maize and sweet potatoes. He hired
    a wagon, and took a load into a firm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> in Ipswich. For the maize he
    received 9d. per bushel, and the sweet potatoes realised sufficient
    to pay the hire for the wagon, leaving him nothing for his labour.”
    He added: “He had seen selectors compelled to walk 4 or 5 miles for
    water, and carry it to their holdings in kerosene tins. Numerous times
    he had seen children waiting for their father’s return with water so
    that they could quench their thirst. Those were the days,” concluded
    Mr. Denning, “when the settlers required ‘grit,’ and he could

  <h3 class="center">Arrived in Queensland with Sixpence—Now a Well-to-do Farmer.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    One of the best known identities in the Clifton district (Darling
    Downs, South Queensland) is Mr. Maas H. Hinz, J.P., typical pioneer,
    and one whose industry and perseverance have done so much to push on
    that busy farming place, Clifton. Mr. M. H. Hinz was born in Holstein,
    Germany, in January, 1841. After leaving school he worked as a farm
    labourer. Left the Fatherland for Queensland on 28th May, 1864, by the
    ship “La Rochelle,” and landed in Brisbane on 6th September, the same
    year. On landing all he
  </p>

  <p class="center noindent"><em>Possessed was a Solitary Sixpence!</em></p>

  <p class="normal">
    After residing two days in the depôt he secured a job with a farmer
    named Mr. R. Wilson, of Biley Creek, at 10s. a week. Subsequent to six
    months with Mr. Wilson, Mr. Hinz got another job on the construction
    work of the Ipswich-Toowoomba Railway line, and later on worked as a
    navvy on the Dalby and Warwick lines. In 1867, when wages were very
    low, he went across to the Burnett district, and took on shepherding
    on Coringa Station. He remained in that district until 1870, and then
    returned to the Toowoomba district, where he took up fencing and
    other contract work until 1872. The discovery of tin at Stanthorpe
    about this time attracted his attention, and he went there to try his
    fortune in the tin rush. On 30th December, the same year, he took up
    760 acres on Back Plains, about 10 miles from Clifton. Three or four
    months after selecting he started working his land. For twelve months
    his life was a lonely one. In December, 1873, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> married, and, to use
    his own words, “the taking up of a farm and the securing of a good
    wife I can safely say were the two best things I ever did in my life.”
    In 1875 he selected another 320 acres. When he secured the last block
    there were no less than thirty-two applicants. His luck was right in
    on that occasion. In 1877 he bought from a neighbour 160 acres; and
    in 1893, when the Clifton Estate was sold, he purchased 960 acres
    adjoining his own property. In 1900 he bought 160 acres from a man
    leaving the district, and shortly afterwards purchased another 760
    acres of grazing land. It will thus be noticed that while working his
    farm land,
  </p>

  <p class="center noindent"><em>By Hard Work and Indomitable Perseverance,</em></p>

  <p class="normal">
    he gradually increased his holdings. During the whole of the time he
    carried on mixed farming—dairying, maize and wheat growing, and sheep
    and horse breeding. Mr. Hinz is a magistrate of many years’ standing,
    and was a member of the divisional board for twelve years, once
    occupying the position of chairman. He was also chairman of the local
    cheese factory, school committee, School of Arts, and several other
    bodies.
  </p>

  <p class="center noindent"><em>Enjoying the Fruits of his Arduous Labours.</em></p>

  <p id="normal" class="noindent">
    His life has been an active as well as useful one, and it is his
    privilege now to enjoy the fruits of his arduous labours and early
    settlement. Mr. Hinz toured the continent of Europe in 1900, and
    visited the Paris Exhibition, as also the earlier scenes of his youth.
    He has reared a family of eight children, five girls, and three boys.
    On January, 1911, on attaining the age of 70, he gave over the farm
    lands to his three sons, who are now working the property on the same
    lines as himself, while he and his wife and two daughters are living
    privately at Clifton. He and his good wife have worthily earned a
    rest, after putting in such good work in developing the district of
    Clifton.

  <h3 class="center">Happy and Contented Russian Settlers.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    Mr. A. Mendrin, of Wycarbah, Central Queensland, under date 27th
    July, 1914, writes as follows:—“In 1912 I visited a large number
    of districts, as I intended taking up some land for agricultural
    purposes. I finally decided on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> a place near Rockhampton known as
    Wycarbah Scrub, close to the Wycarbah Station, on the Queensland
    Central Railway. I decided to start a mixed farm; the climatic and
    other conditions being extremely favourable for the growing and
    cultivating of maize, cotton, potatoes, and various sorts of citrus
    fruits. At the present time I must say that I am highly satisfied
    with my land, so also with the terms and conditions offered me by the
    Government, and subject to which I received my land. As soon as I had
    settled down at Wycarbah, and had started felling and clearing my
    land, I received numerous inquiries from a number of my countrymen,
    who, knowing that I have a thorough theoretical and practical
    knowledge of agriculture in all its branches, requested me to assist
    them in choosing land for agricultural and pastoral purposes. To the
    majority of them I recommended the district where I had chosen my own
    farm. The others whom I had not time to conduct and go round with
    personally, I gave introductions to Mr. Harvey, of the Rockhampton
    Lands Office, where they were given every attention and courtesy, so
    that they did not feel in the least handicapped because of not knowing
    the language. I now bring some of the cases of these men before you.
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">Started with only 100 Roubles (£10.)</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    “Mr. Jacob Sank, in September, 1913, took over 160 acres of land at
    22s. 6d. per acre, with 20 years in which to effect payment, in the
    district of Wycarbah, his whole capital at the time being some £10 =
    Rs. 100. At the present time he has about 15 acres cleared and mostly
    under crop, has built a house, possesses a horse, and intends buying
    a cow shortly; he has also various agricultural implements. All this
    is very much to Mr. Sank’s credit, as, having no money on hand, he
    frequently had to go outside to find work while his various crops were
    coming up in order to make a living. Mr. Sank also intends having a
    mixed agricultural farm.

  <h3 class="center">Russian Naval Gunner’s Success as a Farmer.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    “Mr. P. Hebenko, ex-torpedo-man on a battle cruiser, native of the
    Black Sea district of Russia, arrived in Australia towards the end of
    July, 1913. He took up 160 acres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> of land near my farm in September,
    1913; it is good chocolate soil, and is under brigalow and light
    scrub. Shortly after having taken over his land, Mr. Hebenko got
    his wife and three children from Russia, and they arrived here in
    November, 1913; whereupon Mr. Hebenko promptly left for his farm. I
    last visited his farm in April, 1914. He had by that time cut down,
    cleared, and under crop 8 acres, 6 acres being under maize. He had
    also built a house, and possessed a horse and various agricultural
    implements. Having expended all his ready money, he then set off in
    search of work, which he obtained 9 miles from his home at 9s. per
    day, leaving his family on the farm well provided for by the various
    vegetables and fruits which were growing in the orchard. All his
    children visit an English school at Wycarbah Station, about 1-1/2
    miles from his farm.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “Both the settlers referred to above have expressed themselves highly
    satisfied with everything, and especially with the fate that directed
    them to Australia.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “In addition to those mentioned above, the following also took land in
    the vicinity of Wycarbah:—Messrs. Bikovsky, Pagin, and Krasnih.
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">We Do Not Repent having Left our Native Land.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    “In order to clearly show what a Russian’s opinion of Queensland
    is, I will now give a few extracts from a letter written by a Mr.
    Godalov, of Canungra, South Coast line, dated 24th February, 1911,
    and published in certain Russian newspapers:—’... and so I am to be
    congratulated; 160 acres of superb land, with a healthy beautiful
    climate, within 30 miles of the sea, at an elevation of 3,000 feet,
    and this for 32s. an acre and 20 years to pay it in. I consider it my
    duty to assure you that
  </p>

  <p class="center noindent"><em>We do not Repent ever having left our Native Land,</em></p>

  <p class="normal noindent">
    notwithstanding that my present social position is different to the
    one I occupied in Russia, and also notwithstanding the fact that the
    life here, too, is quite different to life in Russia; nevertheless,
    I have never yet thought that I came out here on a wild-goose chase
    (to say nothing of the children, who cry when we, jokingly, talk of
    returning to Russia), in spite of the fact that my actual income—at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
    present—is smaller than it was in Russia, life here is in no case
    worse. The explanation makes this assertion obvious. I do not have
    to pay mad sums of money for the rent of my house, its heating, the
    educating and upbringing of my children, expensive warm clothing is
    unnecessary, there is no need for you to worry about to-morrow, and
    at last, but by no means leastly, for your own freedom and absolute
    liberty. All this gives a deep reason why Russians should emigrate to
    Australia....’
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “As previously stated, the above are extracts from Mr. Godalov’s
    open letter, he is well-known by the farmers of his district. Other
    characteristic cases are those of Messrs. Danilchenko and Ilyin, in
    North Queensland.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “I satisfy myself with mentioning just these few cases, but, of
    course, there are a good many other similar cases amongst the Russian
    colony in Queensland. I have taken the above cases at random, and
    think that they clearly illustrate that a good, honest, and energetic
    Russian agriculturist cannot find a country with more favourable
    conditions than those offered him by Queensland for applying his
    knowledge and labour to.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “In view of my having received a large number of inquiries as to the
    shortest space of time in which profit can be obtained from land still
    to be cleared, I, in the interests of intending emigrants, would like
    to give the following facts, which are based on my own experiences:—
  </p>

  <h3 class="center">Mr. A. Mendrin’s Experiences.</h3>

  <p class="normal">
    “We will say, then, that you have gone through the formalities of
    obtaining your land (in Queensland they are not complicated). From the
    first day of your arrival on your farm you will start cutting down
    your trees (these are mostly soft), a normally healthy agricultural
    peasant should fell from 2 to 2-1/2 acres of brigalow scrub in a week.
    In this way in a month’s time you should have about ten acres of
    trees felled, provided you started this during the summer months. You
    will want, say 2-1/2 months, for the fallen timber to dry before you
    burn it. Having burnt it, you promptly start sowing maize between the
    stumps, and while this is taking root you continue felling or putting
    up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> your fence, as the case may be. It will take about 105 days for
    your maize to grow. You then pull the cobs, and prepare them for
    drying and threshing, which should take about two weeks, at the end
    of which time you will be in a position to realise your first crop.
    Virgin soil in the district I am speaking of (Wycarbah) will yield
    about 60 bushels of maize to the acre; that is, from 10 acres you will
    get 600 bushels; the average price is 3s. per bushel, or £90 for the
    10 acres you have cleared. In this way seven months have gone by since
    the day on which you started work, and you have £90 in your pocket,
    less from £10 to £12 for various expenses, such as packing, delivery,
    &amp;c. I would like to make it quite clear that I have taken only the
    average price of maize above. Lately this article has been quoted at
    Rockhampton at from 4s. to 4s. 3d. per bushel.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “Knowing how popular pig and poultry breeding and farming is amongst
    Russian peasantry, I can say, with conviction, that these two yield a
    very good source of income, as do all other branches of pastoral and
    agricultural enterprise, all of which I cannot give details of here in
    view of the space such information would take up.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “Finally, I consider it my bounden duty to assert that my two years
    of careful study of agricultural and other conditions of life in
    Queensland give me good foundation on which to consider this country
    as the
  </p>

  <p class="center noindent"><em>Most Convenient, Favourable, and Attractive Country</em></p>

  <p class="normal noindent">
    for the average Russian agricultural or other peasant to emigrate to.
  </p>

  <p class="normal">
    “I have to express my thanks to the Lands Department for the kindness
    and attention shown by them in all cases when Russian subjects have
    approached them requesting advice and assistance.”

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
